# Dog-Breed-Identification-using-Deep-learning-and-CNN
🐶 Dog Breed Identification using Deep Learning and CNN
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify the breed of a dog from an image. It is based on a supervised learning approach using labeled image data, inspired by real-world applications like pet recognition systems and breed detection tools.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV (for image processing)

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains thousands of labeled dog images across various breeds. It includes training and testing image sets. The images were preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting to improve model generalization.

Dataset source: Kaggle Dog Breed Identification

🏗️ Model Architecture
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Layers: Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, Flatten, Dense

Activation Functions: ReLU, Softmax

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam

🎯 Key Features
Classifies images into multiple dog breeds

Data augmentation for better model generalization

Model evaluation using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix

Visualization of training history (accuracy & loss plots)

📈 Results
Achieved high validation accuracy with effective generalization using CNNs. The model shows promising results on unseen dog images.
